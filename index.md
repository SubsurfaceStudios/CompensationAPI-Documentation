# Welcome to the Compensation VR API documentation
Here you can find information about the entirety of the Compensation VR API, with (almost) no exceptions.  
You can find the source code of the API [here](https://github.com/bubby932/VigorXRAPI)  
  
## Introduction
The Compensation VR API is a REST & WebSocket based system for directly interacting with the Compensation VR servers, in exactly
the same way that the game itself or our website would.

<summary>This allows for a number of use cases, including, but not limited to:</summary>  

* Fetching data about a user, such as their username, ID, or bio.  
* Gifting users items.  
* Making purchases without logging into the game.  
* Sending messages automatically, in the vein of a Discord bot.  
* (Coming Soon) Manually downloading, modifying, and reuploading room saves to allow for more advanced operations.
