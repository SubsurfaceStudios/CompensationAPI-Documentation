# Compensation API Documentation
Here you can find information about the entirety of the Compensation VR API, with (almost) no exceptions.  
You can find the source code of the API [here](https://github.com/bubby932/VigorXRAPI)  

## Introduction  
The Compensation VR API is a REST & WebSocket based system for directly interacting with the Compensation VR servers, in exactly
the same way that the game itself or our website would.
